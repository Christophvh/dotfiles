## A Fresh macOS Setup

### Installing macOS cleanly

After going to our checklist above and making sure you backed everything up, we're going to cleanly install macOS with the latest release. Follow [this article](https://www.imore.com/how-do-clean-install-macos) to cleanly install the latest macOS.

### Setting up your Mac

If you did all this you may now follow these install instructions to setup a new Mac.

1. Update macOS to the latest version with the App Store
2. Install Xcode from the App Store, open it and accept the license agreement
3. Install macOS Command Line Tools by running `xcode-select --install`
4. Copy public and private SSH keys to `~/.ssh` and make sure they're set to `600`
5. Clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles`
6. Append `/usr/local/bin/zsh` to the end of your `/etc/shells` file
7. Run `install.sh` to start the installation
8. Restore preferences by running `mackup restore`
9. Restart your computer to finalize the process

Your Mac is now ready to use!

> Note: you can use a different location than `~/.dotfiles` if you want. Just make sure you also update the reference in the `.zshrc` file.

## Your Own Dotfiles

One thing you'll need to do manually is add your `~/.zshrc` file. You can't symlink the `.zshrc` file from your dotfiles because Mackup will already symlink your `.zshrc` from your home directory. That's why we'll need to create the file manually. Add the contents below to a `.zshrc` file in your user directory. What it will do is load the `.zshrc` file from your dotfiles. Make sure that the path to your dotfiles is correct.

```zsh
# Load Zsh
source ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc
```

> I've thought about backing up the `.zshrc` file entirely to Mackup and removing it from this repo. But I like it to be versioned with the repo so I can use it for documentation and as an example. I also believe that it makes more sense to keep it in this repo because it's pretty tied into this repo's files and settings.

When installing these dotfiles for the first time you'll need to backup all of your settings with Mackup. Install and backup your settings with the command below. Your settings will be synced to iCloud so you can use them to sync between computers and reinstall them when reinstalling your Mac. If you want to save your settings to a different directory or different storage than iCloud, [checkout the documentation](https://github.com/lra/mackup/blob/master/doc/README.md#storage).

```zsh
brew install mackup
mackup backup
```
